# SmartRetainer
ECE 431L Project for Kulkarni Orthodontics

# How to contribute
1. 'git pull'
2. Switch to DEV branch

'git checkout DEV'

3. Create a new branch for the feature you want to implement

'git branch myNewFeature'
'git checkout myNewFeature'
'git push --set-upstream origin myNewFeature'

4. While working on the branch, periodically pull and merge DEV into YOUR BRANCH

(On branch 'myNewFeature')
'git pull'
'git merge DEV'

5. When you are done with the feature, push your branch upstream. DO NOT MERGE TO DEV.

'git push'

NEVER TOUCH MASTER
